# The Truth
A game I have been working on for years now...
Entirely in the console, pretty bad code but actually almost fun
You play as a box, and explore your new home, an island that wont let you leave
(unless you find the real ending....)

Has:
- 5 different endings
- Not a single use of pygame even though this would probably be sick in it
- A kinda huge map, with darkness and stuff
- NPCS, Items, interactables like the powerplant etc.
- An easter event (yes i added events, theres definitely not reminants of other ones in there...)
- Bosses...

This is mainly so I remember it exists, the code and exes for both windows and linux/mac/other stuff are in here

# To play on mac (or windows if you want to complie yourself)
To set up the exe from the source code you will need:
- [Python/pip](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (pip3 for mac/linux/whatever)
- run `pip/pip3 install pyinstaller` in your console
- (make sure you are in the current path as the source code before next step, probably downloads)
- run `pyinstaller -F Truth_for_Windows.py/Truth_for_Mac.py`
