# The Truth
Hey MIT, this is Cristian!!!
- A game I have been working on for years now...
- Entirely in the console, pretty bad code (getting better every update!!!) but actually almost fun
- You play as a box, and explore your new home, an island that wont let you leave...
(unless you find the real ending)

Has:
- 5 different endings
- Not a single use of pygame/gui even though this would probably be sick in it
- A kinda huge map, with darkness and stuff
- NPCS, Inventory, Crafting, Items, Achievements, Boss????, Secret Boss???, etcetececet 
- An easter event (yes i added events, theres definitely not reminants of other ones in there...)

This is mainly so I remember it exists, the code for Windows/Mac/Other stuff is here, as well as the already made exe for windows (idk how to make it for other OS)

# FOR NON WINDOWS PEOPLE (or if you want to compile it yourself)
## You will need to: 
- Get [Python/pip](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (pip3 for mac/linux/whatever)
- run `pip/pip3 install pyinstaller` in your console/terminal
- Make sure you `cd` into this folder, then run the following command...
### FOR WINDOWS
- `pyinstaller -F --add-data "Truth/*.wav;Truth/" --add-data "Truth/*.mp3;Truth/" TheTruth.py`
### FOR MAC/other stuff
- `pyinstaller -F --add-data "Truth/*.wav:Truth/" --add-data "Truth/*.mp3:Truth/" TheTruth.py`
